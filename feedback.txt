success

===> Marking Scheme - test cases
******* TestCases: 90%
   There are 9 test input files.
** TestCases 1-8: 59%
   Input files 01 through 08 test specific functionality. Each line in those files is worth 1 mark, for a total of 59 marks.
** TestCases 9: 31%
   Test 09 stress tests the code a huge number of times. It is worth 31 marks total, graded as follows:
   +1: did not segfault
   Then, there are 500K lines in that file:
   +10: at least 50% of the lines correct
   +20: at least 75% of the lines correct
   +30: all lines correct
   With no part marks (so if they get 65% of the lines correct they donâ€™t get +15, just +10).
******* Memory Leak : 10%
   +10: if the total memory leak is zero
